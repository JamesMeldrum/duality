    <h1>Getting started</h1>

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>
      Install the most recent <em>stable</em> version of
      <a href="http://nodejs.org/#download">node</a>, then clone
      <a href="https://github.com/caolan/kanso">kanso</a> from GitHub.
      Fetch the relevant submodules by doing the following in the cloned directory:
    </p>
    <pre>git submodule init
git submodule update</pre>
    <p>You are then ready to install:</p>
    <pre>make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</pre>

    <h3>Using NPM</h3>
    <p>
    If you already have node.js installed, and you're using npm
    (Node Package Manager), then you can install by simply doing the following:
    </p>
    <pre>npm install kanso</pre>

    <h2 id="starting_a_project">Starting a project</h2>
    <p>
      For this tutorial we'll be making a fairly typical blog, with posts,
      comments and users. Some familiarity with CouchDB is expected, but I'll
      try to explain the concepts as we go.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a new project skeleton, enter the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>kanso create myblog</pre>
    <p>
      This creates a number of files and directories representing a basic
      project structure. We'll look more closely at the generated files later,
      but for a brief overview, the directories fall into the following categories:
    </p>
    <pre>myblog
  |- lib             CommonJS modules which define your app
  |- static          Static files such as jQuery and CSS
  |- templates       HTML templates used by the app
  |- kanso.json      Project configuration
    </pre>
    <p>
      This structure is a merely a guide and you are free to place files
      wherever it makes sense, provided you update the configuration settings in
      kanso.json.
    </p>

    <h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
    <p>
      It might seem early in the tutorial to start talking about deployment, but
      since your app needs to be hosted by CouchDB to run, we're going to cover it
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing to mention is that <em>Kanso apps are just CouchApps</em>. This means
      they can be hosted directly from your CouchDB instance, without any additional
      tier or services.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of this tutorial we're going to assume you have CouchDB running
      on <a href="http://localhost:5984">http://localhost:5984</a>
      (the default settings). If you haven't got a local copy of CouchDB running,
      go do that now.
    </p>

    <h3>Pushing</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>push</code> command uploads your app to a CouchDB database. You can find help
      on any of the commands used in this tutorial by typing <code>kanso help</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's push the new project to your CouchDB instance, and check that everthing
      works. To do this, enter the following command from your project directory:
    </p>
    <pre>kanso push http://localhost:5984/myblog</pre>
    <img src="images/deployment1.png" alt="pushing myblog" />
    <p>
      This creates a new database called 'myblog' and uploads your app to it.
      If you now visit <a href="http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/myblog/_rewrite/">http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/myblog/_rewrite/</a>,
      you should see the following welcome page:
    </p>
    <img src="images/deployment2.png" alt="pushing myblog" />
    <p>
      This is the location to use when testing your app. Don't worry about the
      ugly URL, we can fix this later using
      <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Virtual_Hosts">virtual hosts</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="describing_the_data">Describing the data</h2>
    <p>
      Now we've got our new project up and running, let's think about the data
      structures this project requires. Because CouchDB is schemaless, we can make
      lots of changes as we go without having to worry about doing ALTER TABLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only problem is, it can quickly get complicated when manually validating
      documents and checking permissions. Thankfully, kanso provides a powerful
      document validation and permissions tool in the form of Type definitions.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating types</h3>
    <p>
      In the skeleton project we created earlier, there's a file called
      <code>lib/types.js</code>. This is the conventional place to export types.
      Remember, the files in the <code>lib</code> directory are 
      <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1">CommonJS modules</a>.
      This means anything added to the <code>exports</code> object in this file is
      made visible to other modules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's create a type for describing blog posts. Add the following to
      <code>lib/types.js</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">var Type = require('kanso/types').Type,
    fields = require('kanso/fields'),
    widgets = require('kanso/widgets');


exports.blogpost = new Type('blogpost', {
    fields: {
        created: fields.timestamp(),
        title: fields.string(),
        text: fields.string({
            widget: widgets.textarea({cols: 40, rows: 10})
        })
    }
});
</code></pre>
    <p>
      That should be fairly self-explanatory.
      The first argument to the <code>Type</code> constructor is the type name
      which must be unique, the second argument is an object describing fields
      and other options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we've added a basic type, let's push these changes to the server:
    </p>
    <img src="images/deployment1.png" alt="pushing myblog" />

    <h3>The Admin App</h3>
    <p>
      As a useful way to play with data types, kanso provides a basic admin app.
      You can push this app to the same database you pushed the 'myblog' project to
      by using the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>kanso pushadmin http://localhost:5984/myblog</pre>
    <img src="images/describing_the_data1.png" alt="push the admin app" />
    <p>
      If you now visit
      <a href="http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/admin/_rewrite/">http://localhost:5984/myblog/_design/admin/_rewrite/</a>
      you should see the following page:
    </p>
    <img src="images/describing_the_data2.png" alt="admin app - apps list" />
    <p>
      Because you can have multiple apps running on a single database you will be
      presented with a list of available applications. Click the 'myblog' app.
    </p>
    <img src="images/describing_the_data3.png" alt="admin app - app overview" />
    <p>
      Here, we are presented with a list of types. Currently, we just have the one
      'blogpost' type. Clicking on this will show you a list of existing blog posts:
    </p>
    <img src="images/describing_the_data4.png" alt="admin app - type list" />
    <p>
      Of course, we haven't added any yet. Let's try adding one now. Click the
      'Add blogpost' link.
    </p>
    <img src="images/describing_the_data5.png" alt="admin app - adding a type" />
    <p>
      As you can see, the admin app has read the field settings we defined earlier
      and presented us with a sensible form for adding blog posts. You'll notice the
      <code>timestamp</code> field is missing. This is because it's automatically
      populated with the current time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a blog post by filling out the form with some test data and clicking
      the create button.
    </p>
