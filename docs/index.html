    <h1>What is Kanso?</h1>

    <h2>Future of web-apps</h2>
    <p>
      Modern web development increasingly means pushing more logic onto the client.
      This provides us with fast and responsive interfaces, but not without cost.
      When grafted onto traditional web-frameworks, rich interfaces require the
      complete re-implementation of features on both the server and client-side.
      Form validation, Templating and URL routing must either be handled at both
      ends or become fragile and insecure.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's needed is a harmonious environment which shares code between the
      browser and server, without 'breaking the web'. Search engines and
      other users should still have access to key content, even if we accept a
      less featureful experience. CouchApps and CouchDB provide us with the
      building blocks to make this vision a reality. A JavaScript environment for
      querying and storing your data, accessible directly from the browser, which
      can scale down to your phone and up to your cluster in the cloud.
    </p>

    <h2>CouchApps made simple</h2>

    <p>
      The problem with CouchApps, is that although using the same language on
      server and client, the environment is different. This leads people to
      implement client-side only solutions, using whole new APIs and JavaScript
      frameworks such as <a href="http://sammyjs.org/">Sammy.js</a> or
      <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where Kanso comes in, an attempt to harmonize the environment between
      CouchDB and the browser by implementing the design doc API client-side, and
      providing the same CommonJS environment for sharing modules. On top of this
      foundation will be built one of the first real attempts at a powerful,
      full-featured CouchApp framework. Designed with non-JavaScript fall-backs
      and logic sharing in mind.
